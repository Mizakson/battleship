## Project Overview
This the final project of The Odin Project's JavaScript course. It's a classic game of Battleship built from the ground up using entirely vanilla JavaScript. This project helped me gain a solid understanding of core JavaScript concepts, including ES6 modules, factory functions, and unit testing.

For a complete breakdown of the rules, please refer to the official [rules of battleship](https://officialgamerules.org/game-rules/battleship/)
