## Project Overview
This the final project of The Odin Project's JavaScript course. It's a classic game of Battleship built from the ground up using entirely vanilla JavaScript. This project helped me gain a solid understanding of core JavaScript concepts, including ES6 modules, factory functions, and unit testing.

For a complete breakdown of the rules, please refer to the official [rules of battleship](https://officialgamerules.org/game-rules/battleship/)

Key:

  * __Blue Square__: Represents a ship in your own fleet.
  
  * __Green Square__: Indicates a successful hit on a ship.
  
  * __Red Square__: Marks a missed shot.

## Features
* __Play against the CPU__: Take on a challenging computer opponent in a game of Battleship.

* __Preset Ship Configurations__: Choose from a selection of pre-configured ship placements to get into the game quickly.

* __Game Reset__: Start a new game at any time with a single click.

## Tech Stack
* __Vanilla JavaScript__: The core game logic and user interface are built entirely with vanilla JavaScript, emphasizing clean and modular code.

* __Jest__: A powerful JavaScript testing library used to ensure the reliability and correctness of all game functions through unit and integration tests.

* __Webpack & Babel__: These are used for module bundling and transpiling to ensure the code works seamlessly across all modern browsers.

* __style-loader__: A Webpack loader that helps properly load and inject CSS files into the DOM after the application is built.
